- create a baseline by shuffling the time sequence
    - done* shuffled series also give significant correlation, try to filter out noise
    - done* at least we confirmed that shuffle baseline works for phase shift effect
    - done* ideas: normalized entropy might work (both globally normalized, and locally normalized within dialogue)

- new analysis w.r.t. phase shift
	- peak-to-peak phase shift, phase wrapping?? (Oullier et al., 2008)

- done* try out the blank space included time series.
- done* train language model and compute entropy for the Danish corpus
- done* try PSO analysis on normalized entropy
- train the lm in a different way, 10-fold cross validation maybe
- *unnecessary compute turn-based entropy for maptask
