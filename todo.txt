- create a baseline by shuffling the time sequence
    - shuffled series also give significant correlation, try to filter out noise 

done - try out the blank space included time series.
- train language model and compute entropy for the Danish corpus
- try PSO analysis on normalized entropy
- train the lm in a different way, 10-fold cross validation maybe
- compute turn-based entropy for maptask
